# COVID-19-NGA-Dashboard
This dashboard was created to graphically inform health professionals about metrics of the virus they may be interested in. It enables the user to view the number of deaths that have occurred, recoveries and people that have been vaccinated.

## Data Cleaning, Analysis and Dashboard Creation Process
The data was cleaned and analyzed in Microsoft Excel while the dashboard was created in Power BI. The documentation that comprehensively explains the preprocessing and dashboard creation process was written in Medium and the link to it can be found here: [Exploring Nigeria's data](https://medium.com/@Nelson_Abolaji/exploring-nigerias-covid-19-data-d01ece73568a)
