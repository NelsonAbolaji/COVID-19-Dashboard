# COVID-19-NGA-Dashboard
This dashboard was created to graphically show public health professionals and other interested individuals metrics of the virus they may be curious about. A few things it does is that it enables the user to view the number of deaths that have occurred, recoveries and people that have been vaccinated. 

*This dashboard was created on the 18th of May, 2023.*

## Data Cleaning, Analysis and Dashboard Creation Process
The data was cleaned and analyzed in Microsoft Excel while the dashboard was created in Power BI. The documentation that comprehensively explains the preprocessing and dashboard creation process was written in Medium and the link to it can be found here: [Exploring Nigeria's data](https://medium.com/@Nelson_Abolaji/exploring-nigerias-covid-19-data-d01ece73568a)

2. There has been no recorded death to COVID-19 in 2023.

4. More than half of the countryâ€™s population remains unvaccinated.
5. Documentation of certain data, such as the number of tests done, the positive rate and stringency index stopped in 2023, which may all be an evidence of a fall in the stringency index.
